# Hydrogen Controller Simulation for Polypropylene Plant
<p align="center">
<p align="justify">
This simulation is part of a hydrogen controller stability investigation in a bulk polymerization of propylene (polypropylene plant). This code is only a few parts that could be released due to confidentiality. The simulation is being done using Simulink with the help of S-function due to the problem's complexity.

The stability analysis can be done by a "try and error" of the value of engineering units, PID constants, and dead time value. The result then can be used as a comparison for the real response on the plant.
